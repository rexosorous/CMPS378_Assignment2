# CMPS378 Assignment #2: Change Calculator
### Submitted By: J-Zach Loke

# Description
This program calculates the most efficient way to dispense change for a transaction. In this case, "most efficient" refers to using the least amount of coins as possible. For example: if the value of change to be dispensed is $0.25, then it's more efficient to dispense 1 quater than 25 pennies.

This program is intended to be integrated into POS (point of sale) machines in businesses.

# Features
This program has the optional ability to calculate dispensal of 50 cent coins.

# How to Run
Compile `main.cs` and `ChangeCalculator.cs` using a C# compiler (preferrably Visual Studio's compiler). I specificually used `Microsoft (R) Visual C# Compiler version 2.6.0.62329`.
